# About

This is a little project I wrote to try out the C++ language. 
Usually I'm working in C#, Typescript, or Python, but recently I've been curious to try out more low level languages.

# Experience

Overall, it was an interesting experience writing a very small amount of C++ code. The syntax isn't completely far off from what I've written before which is no surprise given that C and C++ have heavily influenced other languages.

I'm going to explore more projects in C++ and possibly C to get more familiar with the syntax and other features that the languages offer.
